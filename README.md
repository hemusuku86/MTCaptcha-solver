MTCaptcha Solver<br>
image solver is bad because it is just google geminiðŸ˜­ (im not good at deep learning or something)
# usage
```py
import MTCaptcha

# proxyless is supported but proxy is highly recommended cuz of ip ratelimit
MTCaptcha.solve("MTPublic-KzqLY1cKH","https://2captcha.com/ja/demo/mtcaptcha","https://your.proxy:1111") # "v1(e86aa0e2,f76e3f5b,MTPublic-KzqLY1cKH,2d8f15eece1d779848ea..." or "Failed"
```
